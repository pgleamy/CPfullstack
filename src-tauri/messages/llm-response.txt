Ah, the classic tongue twister. Honestly, I don't think anyone's got a real number on that, do they? It's one of those things that's just meant to trip you up when you say it fast. But if we're gettin' technical, I heard once that a scientist actually figured a woodchuck could chuck around 700 pounds of dirt in one go. Go figure. But wood? Nah, that's just for the rhyme. So, what's kickin' around your head aside from chuckin' wood, huh?
