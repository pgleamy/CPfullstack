The user experience of user my application user input area:

This editor is always 9 lines tall, but will auto-hide if you click out of it or use the custom scroll controls. 

If you want to read the conversation and see your draft prompt at the same time, just scroll the conversation with the scroll wheel after clicking on the editor.

The "send" button is always visible, so you don't need to click on the prompt area to send your prompt if the prompt area is hidden.

The editor is hidden to a shadow of itself if the user click out of it or uses the custom scrolling controls (ie, not the mouse wheel). This allows a full top to bottom review experience of the conversation history, because the header also auto hides.

The prompt area (editor) has Undo and Redo. To undo, use Crtl-z. To redo, use Crtl-y. 

What do you think of this?
