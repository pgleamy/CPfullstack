Hi Jarvis, Thanks so much for your response. I have been configuring the interface. This requires many restarts of the application for testing. Each restart causes you to respond to the last prompt I sent to you, despite having already replied to it many times before. I would like to prevent that from happening, but I am focused on the user interface and configuring Svelte stores. So until I tell you otherwise, it would be extremely helpful if you only reply with "OK" and absolutely nothing else, no commentary, nothing, until further notice.
