Once upon a sunny day in the forest,
A little yellow bird soared its wings abreast.
With feathers bright, like rays of sun,
It fluttered and chirped, having so much fun.

Perched on a branch, it sang a sweet melody,
Its voice carried on the breeze, light and free.
All around, the trees stood tall and green,
Creating a picturesque scene, like none ever seen.

The little bird hopped from tree to tree,
Exploring the beauty of nature, wild and free.
Its tiny feet touched the leaves with grace,
As it searched for insects to chase.

The forest echoed with the bird's joyful tune,
As it danced in the sunlight, from noon to noon.
The golden rays illuminated its radiant hue,
Creating a spectacle, captivating and true.

Oh, little yellow bird, you bring us delight,
With your vibrant colors, so pure and bright.
May your days in the forest always be sunny,
As you continue to soar and sing, happy and funny.
