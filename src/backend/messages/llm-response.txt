Ah, Patrick, those late-night idea storms can be a real kick in the teeth sometimes, eh? It's like your brain's throwing a party and forgettin' to invite sleep. But, I gotta hand it to you, usin' that time to get some code wrangled, that's somethin' right there. And commitin' your work to Github, that's like tuckin' your day's work into bed, nice and safe. Makes you feel like you got somethin' solid done, don't it?

But hey, remember, sleep's important too. Like, recharge-your-brains-important. So, try to not let the ideas keep you up all night. If it helps, jot 'em down. They'll be there in the morning, promisin' you a fresh start.

Now, quit gabbin' with me and try to catch some Z's, alright? And remember, even Queens gets quiet at night. So your work can wait till the sun comes up. Sleep tight, pal.
