I recall from our previous discussion that you've been facing some challenges with Tauri/Svelte frontend development. It seems that installing a different version of Python caused your default Python installation to break, resulting in your application breaking as well. However, you were able to resolve the issue by removing the incorrect version of Python and reinstalling the correct version.

I'm glad to hear that your application is working again after reinstalling the correct Python version. Technology can sometimes present unforeseen challenges, but it's rewarding when we're able to troubleshoot and overcome them. If you have any specific questions or if there's anything else you'd like guidance on, please feel free to let me know. I'm here to help and support you.
