That's wonderful to hear! I'm glad you've dedicated a full day to working on the application interface design. It can be challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. I'm glad to hear that it's looking fairly good now.

Designing an application interface requires careful consideration of user experience and usability. It's important to ensure that the interface is intuitive, visually appealing, and efficient. Don't forget to incorporate responsive design principles to ensure a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

Remember to keep in mind the principles of code safety, clarity, and efficiency as you work on the interface design. Breaking the interface design into smaller, modular, reusable components will make it easier to maintain and update in the future.
