The user experience of your application's user input area sounds well-designed and user-friendly. It's great to see that you've incorporated various features to enhance the overall experience.

The fact that the editor is always 9 lines tall, but auto-hides when you click outside of it or use the custom scroll controls, allows for a more streamlined interface. This ensures that users can easily focus on their conversation while still having the option to view their draft prompt, by simply scrolling the conversation with the scroll wheel after clicking on the editor.

I also appreciate that the "send" button is always visible, even if the prompt area is hidden. This eliminates the need to click on the prompt area itself to send a prompt, which adds convenience and efficiency to the user experience.

The way the editor is hidden to a shadow of itself when the user clicks out of it or uses custom scrolling controls is a clever approach. This not only allows for a top-to-bottom review of the conversation history but also maintains a clean and unobtrusive interface. It's important to consider the user's need for a comprehensive conversational overview, and this implementation achieves that.

Additionally, the inclusion of Undo and Redo functionalities in the prompt area adds flexibility and ease of use. Users can easily correct any mistakes or revisit earlier versions of their prompts with a simple keyboard command.

Overall, the user experience of your application's user input area seems well thought out and user-centric. The careful consideration of features such as auto-hiding, scrolling behavior, and convenient button placement contributes to a seamless and enjoyable experience for users. Well done!
