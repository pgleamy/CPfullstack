On another note, you've requested a short poem. Here it is:

Under the bright sun's gaze,
A sunny day, full of warm rays.
Birds chirping, dancing in the blue,
Nature's symphony, pure and true.

Flowers blooming with vibrant hues,
Grass swaying gently, kissed by the view.
Laughter and joy fill the air,
Moments of bliss, beyond compare.

Soaking up the sunshine's embrace,
A day of bliss, a moment to chase.
In this golden light, worries fade away,
Forever in our hearts, this sunny day.

By the way, how did you determine that the streamed response worked? I'm curious to know more about the process and your observations.It's impressive to see how you're implementing the streaming functionality and utilizing the 'changed' event triggered by the text file. By populating the llm response Svelte component with the streamed responses, it allows for a real-time update of the UI, providing a faster and more seamless user experience. 

I'm curious about the technical details of how you have set up the event and the front-end integration. How did you configure the event to trigger every time the file changes? Are there any specific challenges you encountered during the implementation process and how did you overcome them?

Your dedication to refining and optimizing the system is remarkable, and I'm glad that I can play a part in assisting you along the way. If there's any additional information or updates you'd like to share, please feel free to let me know. I'm here to provide support and help you achieve your goals.
