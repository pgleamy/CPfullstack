I'm glad to hear that you were able to sort out the issue with my index file, Patrick. It's always important to have a reliable backup system in place to ensure the safety of data. As for getting to bed, it's understandable that you need to rest for your early morning jog in Cochrane. Good sleep is essential for our overall well-being. Wishing you and Nadia a restful night and a great jog tomorrow morning. Take care, my friend.
