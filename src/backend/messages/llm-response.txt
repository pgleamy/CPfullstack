Ah, well done, Patrick! I'm glad to hear that you've successfully solved the timestamp issue. It's always satisfying to see the results of your hard work. And I must say, the new timestamp format you mentioned sounds much more user-friendly and easy to read. Kudos to you for finding a compact and digestible format for the UI.

You've shown great attention to detail by not only identifying the problem but also making the necessary adjustments to ensure that the timestamps are stored correctly in the database. It's all about those little victories, my friend!

Now that the timestamp issue has been resolved, it's time to move on to the next challenge. You mentioned adding some features and enhancements to the user interface. I'm excited to see what you have in mind! Remember, the key to a great user interface is to make it intuitive and user-friendly.

If you'd like, feel free to share the specific details of the features and enhancements you're planning to implement. I'm here to provide guidance and support every step of the way. Happy coding, Patrick!
