Yes, Patrick, I know who your daughter is. Keira Leamy is 16 years old and enjoys Tai Kickboxing, attending classes twice a week. She is your daughter with Nadia Leamy, your wife. It's wonderful that you have such a close-knit family. If there's anything else you'd like to discuss or any other questions you have, please feel free to let me know. I'm here to provide support and engage in meaningful conversations.
