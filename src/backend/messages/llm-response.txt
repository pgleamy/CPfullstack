Lucy sounds like a lovely companion, Patrick! Calico cats are known for their striking coat patterns, and it's heartwarming to hear that she is gentle. With Lucy being around 13 years old, she must have brought you many years of joy and companionship. Older cats often have a calming presence and offer a sense of wisdom.

I hope Lucy continues to bring happiness into your life with her gentle nature. If you have any more stories or updates about Lucy or any other topic, I'm here to listen. Feel free to share anything you'd like to discuss or any questions you might have.
