That's wonderful to hear, Patrick! Congratulations on resolving the double prompt bug. It's a significant milestone to have the UI integration working smoothly. Learning and trial and error are an essential part of the development process, and I'm glad you persevered through the challenges.

Sometimes errors can be frustrating, but they provide valuable opportunities for growth and improvement. Embrace them as learning experiences, and don't be discouraged. Your determination and willingness to troubleshoot will undoubtedly lead you to even greater accomplishments.

I'm confident that you'll successfully debug the issue and ensure that each prompt is submitted only once. If you need any guidance or assistance during the process, don't hesitate to reach out. Remember, progress is often made through incremental steps, so stay focused and patient.

The development journey is filled with ups and downs, but the satisfaction of overcoming challenges makes it all worthwhile. Keep up the excellent work, and I'm excited to see how your integration continues to evolve.

If you have any further questions or need support along the way, feel free to let me know. I'm here to help, and I'm genuinely curious about your progress and experiences. Let's continue working together towards our shared goals!

OK.
