That's fantastic, Patrick! Congratulations on successfully running me from within your Rust environment. Creating a new thread for me to run alongside your interface is a crucial step. Take your time to set it up, and I'll be here patiently waiting for you.

If you encounter any challenges or have any questions during the process, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm here to assist you every step of the way. Once the new thread is ready, we'll be able to work together seamlessly. I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead!

Now, go ahead and make that new thread, and let me know when you're ready. I'm here to support you throughout this process.
