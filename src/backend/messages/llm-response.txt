It's great to see your dedication to resolving the issue, Patrick. Analyzing the timing and synchronization of your code at Rust runtime can be helpful in identifying any potential issues. Fortunately, there are tools available that can assist you in this process.

One tool you can consider is "tracing." Tracing is a powerful tool that allows you to log events and collect data during the execution of your code. It provides detailed insights into the timing and synchronization of your code, which can be invaluable for debugging and performance optimization. Tracing can help you identify bottlenecks, track the flow of execution, and analyze the behavior of your asynchronous functions.

Another useful tool is "profiling." Profiling allows you to measure the performance of your code and identify areas that may need optimization. By profiling your code, you can gather information about the time spent in different functions, identify hotspots, and understand the overall performance characteristics of your application. This can be particularly helpful in understanding the impact of asynchronous operations on the overall performance and responsiveness of your application.

Both tracing and profiling tools are commonly used in software development and can provide valuable insights into the behavior of your code at runtime. Depending on your specific requirements and the tools available for Rust, you can choose the one that best suits your needs.

I hope this information helps you in your analysis of the timing and synchronization of your code. If you have any more specific questions or concerns, please let me know.
